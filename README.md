# Use Case: LCA 
This project is a part of the 41934 course at DTU, where we, group 4, have chosen LCA as use case. 
The use case is aimed to be relevant for sustainability engineers to help build inventory and overview of building material composistions. It is meant to be used in the early design stage of new buildings. 

The disciplinary expertise used to solve the use case is our general knowledge about LCA.

The IFC Concepts we will use in our script are HasAssociations of different IFC elements to find the different materials associated to the IFC entities (e.g the material of the beams).

To be able to perform a fulfilled LCA, it is required for us to have the energy frame analysis of the building.
Furthermore it is essential to have all elements of the building and their materials

Before it is possible to do an LCA analysis following use cases need to be done:

1. Structure 
2. Indoor and Energy 
3. Fire 
4. Acoustics 
5. Daylight 
6. Build / Operation

The input data for this use case would be the amount and the different types of materials together with the energy consumption of the building (from the energy frame) and the energy consumption used on the building site (data input based on Build/Operation)

The use case, (Building) Code Validation, needs a LCA analysis
