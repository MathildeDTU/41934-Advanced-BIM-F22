# Final Project Reflection Report 
A general problem for all three LCA groups was that the tools are developed for the specific IFC file. Therefore, a future step for all groups were to generalize the tools to function more generally. Another interesting idea, that we talked about between the groups, was to have workshops within the same topic to discuss difficulties. In that connection we reached the conclusion that we have had many of the same problems. The workshops could help overcome these and create a more effective workflow.
For future use cases regarding LCA, connecting product specific EPD's to JSon would be of great interest. This would work close together with being able to easely extract quantities of different materials from the IFC files and then automatically import it into LCA Byg through JSon files. The last step would be to create a great user interface where the LCA results are automatically being updated, when the IFC files updates. 

##  The process of creating/developig the tool
In relation to IFC-files, we have learned a lot about the structure of IFC. Furthermore, the structure of these needs to be bulletproof for the case-specific investigation, so the tool that is built can extract the information automatically.

### Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
In some way yes, it introduces the OpenBIM tool. However, the course needs a clearer structure, to give the students a better overview of what is expected from them from the start. 

### Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
The number of choices fit perfectly for the case studies. However, more focus on the background knowledge before the choices were made could be beneficial. 

### Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?
The HTML-part could easily be switched out with some more IFC-specific coding, so we could learn the step from blenderpy to e.g. Python easier.
LCA-specific feedback; introduction to .JSON files, which is useful when exporting to LCAByg. This could be taught or made into videos of ‘how to’ for the groups that need it.

## Output of the tool
### Did the tool address the use case you identified?
oYes, the use case was to perform a check of an IFC-model, which was performed. Furthermore, a simple concept of the material amounts (kg, m3, m2) to later be used in LCA calculations was initiated.

### Was the use case well modelled and clearly scoped
That depended on our own composition since the guidelines for the use cases weren’t strict. Judging from our feedback and our own perception, we think the case was well modelled and clearly scoped.  As mentioned before, we would have liked to have received a clearer introduction to what was expected from us from the start. 

## Future
### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis
Yes, probably. 
### Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
Probably
