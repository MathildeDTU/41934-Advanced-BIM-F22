# Final Project Reflection Report 
Maybe write general reflection to LCA topic here

##  The process of creating the tool
o	In relation to IFC-files, we have learned a lot about the structure of IFC. 
o	This structure needs to be bulletproof for the case-specific investigation, so the tool that is built can extract the information automatically.

## Process of developing the tool
### Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
o	In some way yes, it introduces the OpenBIM tool. However, the course needs a clearer structure, to give the students a better overview of what is expected from them from the start. 

### Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
o	The number of choices fit perfectly for the case studies. However, more focus on the background knowledge before the choices were made could be beneficial. 

### Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?
o	The HTML-part could easily be switched out with some more IFC-specific coding, so we could learn the step from blenderpy to e.g. Python easier.
o	LCA-specific feedback; introduction to .JSON files, which is useful when exporting to LCAByg. This could be taught or made into videos of ‘how to’ for the groups that need it.
