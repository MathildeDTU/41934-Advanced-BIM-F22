To license our own work, we first look at Tim’s repository “HTML-Build-IFC-Converter”. We do this because many licenses require the same license for derivative work. Tim’s repository has no license file or license specifications stated in the folders or README.md. The only thing that is explicitly stated in the README.md is:  

"Can I try? 

Sure, best way to start is to grab the repo and then run duplex.py as the main.py references files that aren't included in this repo. 

Can I help? 

Sure, my (tim's) coding skills are crappy but enthusistic, more skilled contributions, are definately welcome :)". 

This is in line with the “public” repository permissions, that allows the owner to choose contributions through pull request.   

Following the GitHub guide to "Licensing a repository", it is stated that for a repository to be truly open source it must have a license. The project is marked “public” however this is not the same as a license. The guide states that it is best practice to include the license in the project and that if there is no license, the work will by default fall under the copyright laws. Since no license is included in the project, this means that it falls under exclusive copyright and that we are not allowed to use, modify, or share the software (https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/).  

 

If we where to choose a license for our own work and “ask the maintainers nicely to add a license”, we would follow the “Open source guide”, use an “Existing projects and communities” and choose the ISC License. This license is functionally equivalent to the MIT and BSD 2-Clause licenses. The license is preferred by OpenBSD which “strives to provide code that can be freely used, copied, modified, and distributed by anyone and for any purpose”. This license allows people to:
